    <h1>architects</h1>
    <main>

        <p>Inspired by a philosophical movement, this post modernism style took shape and acquired fame through architecture. It was the discovery of freedom to manipulate materials and shapes, break it all, and bring in new, perplexing, insane, chaotic, constructions.In other words, a deconstructive architect is probably the biggest headache for any engineer.<br>What seems to be shocking is actually a controled chaos, precisely studied and planned. Sketches present calculated distortions, traditional structures being tear apart and its fragments rebuilt onto new and unexpected shapes, contradicting what our eyes would expect.<br>The intention is to reconfigurate shapes and break the rules, building structures thought to be impossible. Constant manipulation, unpredictability and some level of discomfort for the comon eye, represents this style.</p>
        <p><strong>ZAHA HADID</strong><br>known as the “Queen of Curve”, shows extense use of geometric shapes, curves, realignments, sharp angles, dynamic and fluid structures constructed from fragmented elements.</p>

        <p><strong>REM KOOLHAAS</strong><br>Seatle`s Central Library was inspired by a pile of books, each floor being one. The building`s unique pile of books concept still impresses and its known to be one of the constructions that better represents this style.</p>
